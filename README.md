## Project description

An android timetable mobile application for Sein√§joki University of Applied Sciences students. Mainly written in java with user interfaces defined in xml. Project was made during my time as a student in SeAMK when there was no official timetable mobile application.

The application requests timetable data from SeAMK's Peppi servers in json format via REST-api get and post requests. Some parts of the application are using older APIs and some are using newer faster Elasticsearch API endpoints.
